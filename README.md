# Higgs_Boson_Identification
Kaggle Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgsboson).
This project is based on the Kaggle Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgsboson).

Adoption of a Pattern Recognition/Machine Learning approach to classify collision events into “tau tau decay of a Higgs boson” 
versus “background”. Given a set of features extracted from simulated LHC collision events, classify them as being related to a Higgs boson or 
background event. To achieve this goal, several steps of a pattern recognition system should be undertaken such as:
    - (i) pre-processing phase 
    - (ii) feature reduction 
    - (iii) feature selection 
    - (iv) pattern recognition techniques 
    - (v) experimental test analysis.
    
Project developed in MATLAB.
